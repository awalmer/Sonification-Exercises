## Hi there! I'm Aura. 👋

I'm a [research fellow](https://rjionline.org/person/auralee-walmer/) with the Reynolds Journalism Institute, focusing on building a **data sonification toolkit**. I also work as a [data curator](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. 💻

I love data, live music, art, acoustic ecology, Monty Python, roadtrips, improv comedy, and fantasy fiction. 🧙‍♂️

My fellowship project: [The Data Sonification Toolkit](https://www.sonificationkit.com/). 📈🔊
