##Hi there! I'm Aura. 👋

I'm a research fellow with the Reynolds Journalism Institute, focusing on building a data sonification toolkit. I also work as a data curator at the University of Michigan. 💻

I love data, live music, art, acoustic ecology, Monty Python, roadtrips, improv comedy, and fantasy fiction. 🧙‍♂️

My fellowship project: [The Data Sonification Toolkit](https://www.sonificationkit.com/). 📈🔊
