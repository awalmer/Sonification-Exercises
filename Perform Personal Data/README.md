## Perform Personal Data

_Use your personal data, for example when you typically eat meals during the course of day._ 

_Using the audio of a ticking clock (inlcludes 25 ticks, 24 whole seconds) as your time marker, perform a sound to represent when your meals happen over a 24-hour period. You can use your voice, clap your hands, whistle, etc._

_Maybe you can rope other people into your performance._ 🕺🏽🪩
